## Project Summary

Our project aims to aid parents who have children who are interested in gaming by allowing them to search and find games for their kids that would be safe for them. We will be creating a web application that takes in user input data and stores it which we will then use to aid in the search of steam’s game database for game titles. An example of this would be how we take age as data from our user and then filter the data that our user searches for based on the age we were given. This project will involve designing the web application to have a page where we can take in a search and display results and also a page where we will visualize collective data from all users. Our project will also include data visualizations for the users which will help them see what kind of things the community of users is searching for and can help parents see what kind of genres are currently popular. In conclusion, the problem we aim to solve is that parents don’t want their children being exposed to mature games at a young age so we want to help parents find games for their children that would be suitable for their maturity level.
