# team036-TeamTBD
Our project aims to aid parents who have children who are interested in gaming by allowing them to search and find games for their kids that would be safe for them. We created a web application that takes in user input data, stores it in the databse, and is used to aid in the search through steam’s game database for game titles. This project will involve designing a web application to display results. In conclusion, the problem we aim to solve is that parents don’t want their children being exposed to mature games at a young age, so we want to help parents find games for their children that would be suitable for their maturity level.
